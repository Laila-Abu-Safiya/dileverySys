# Learning Process
**Experts in software architecture and design are highly paid, because they know how to create 
designs that are flexible, elegant, and reusable. **You become an expert through experience, 
reusing solutions that worked for you before. **Patterns describe solutions to design problems
that occur over and over again. **Patterns also record design decisions, alternatives, and 
trade-offs gained from experience. **Once you know the pattern, many design decisions follow. 
**Knowing patterns helps you get designs right faster. **Knowing the vocabulary surrounding 
patterns helps communication between designers, and can ease the documentation effort.
